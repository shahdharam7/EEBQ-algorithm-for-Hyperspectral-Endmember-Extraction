# Title : 
Hyperspectral Endmember Extraction using Band Quality

# Abstract:
Due to low spatial resolution, intimate mixing of materials and multiple scattering, pixels are of mixed types in hyperspectral images. Analyzing these mixed pixels using spectral characteristics is Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA). SMA finds the number of pure endmembers along with their pure signature and fractions of materials in the image. In this analysis, the critical part is extracting pure endmembers from the image itself. There are many attempts by researchers to extract endmembers but none of them are considering the quality of each band. In this paper, a novel Endmember Extraction using Band Quality (EEBQ) is proposed which uses the concept of band quality and convex geometry. The proposed algorithm is examined on synthetic and real benchmark datasets, which demonstrates its worthy performance in terms of spectral angle error, spectral information divergence, and normalized cross-correlation.
